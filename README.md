These projects are the part of `Tensorflow-in-practice` specializations  or MIT 6.S191 course. I have completely done the specializations.

## Description_of_Projects

### 1. Predicting Shakespearse'works

##### Language used - Python
##### Toolwork for DL - Tensorflow
##### Model - LSTM

This is a project of Natural Language Processing. In this project, we used work of Shakespearse's sonnet to predict more text. The training data was scrapped by [Laurence Moroney](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/lmoroney)
and saved as a text file. Firstly, we tokenize the whole text file and then used n-grams to make data usefull. In the model, we used a Biderctional LSTM and a LSTM layer to train.
Also, we used dropout to reduce the chances of overfitting. For prediction, we used seed text from Shakespearse's `Verily, A new hope`.
